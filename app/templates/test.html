<h2> Four Olympic medals stolen from Australian rower’s car</h2><p> <b>Police have arrested</b> and charged a man for allegedly stealing four Olympic medals belonging to Australian rower Drew Ginn. But the medals – three gold and a silver – are still missing. </p><p> <i>The 47-year-old man,</i> who was wanted on a warrant over the alleged theft, was arrested on Wednesday in Brunswick, a northern suburb of Melbourne. Authorities said Ginn’s medals were believed to have been stolen from the back of a Land Rover parked in the Victorian capital about a week ago. </p><p> A GoPro camera, headphones and a wetsuit were also stolen, with police saying Ginn had left them along with the medals inside his car during a speaking engagement at a school. </p><ul><li> cheese</li> <li> fruits</li> <li> juice</li> <li> beer</li> <li> red</li></ul><p> Ginn is one of Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletes and was a member of the champion rowing crew known as  <a href="https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/drew-ginn/">“The Oarsome Foursome.”</a>  </p><p> He won the medals during a nearly two decade Olympic career that began at the 1996 games in Atlanta and continued through to the London Olympics in 2012. </p><p> “They’ve got a lot of value for family and friends… but you can’t insure them,” Ginn told public broadcaster  <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-breakfast/drew-ginn/104336196">ABC Radio Melbourne</a>  on Friday. </p><p> “They were hidden away in the car but the car was ransacked completely so lots of stuff was broken and destroyed,” he added. </p><p> The 49-year-old voiced hope that, rather than being sold, the medals might find their way back to their rightful owner. </p><img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap080816012084.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp" alt="two winers"><ul><li> cheese</li> <li> fruits</li> <li> juice</li> <li> beer</li> <li> red</li> <li> green</li></ul><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://rutube.ru/play/embed/a58f615b5c060e3d1d49ff88b64c7d01/" frameBorder="0" allow="clipboard-write; autoplay" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><ol><li> apples</li> <li> school</li> <li> congress</li></ol>
