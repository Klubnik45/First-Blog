## Four Olympic medals stolen from Australian rower’s car

**Police have arrested** and charged a man for allegedly stealing four Olympic medals belonging to Australian rower Drew Ginn. But the medals – three gold and a silver – are still missing.

*The 47-year-old man,* who was wanted on a warrant over the alleged theft, was arrested on Wednesday in Brunswick, a northern suburb of Melbourne. Authorities said Ginn’s medals were believed to have been stolen from the back of a Land Rover parked in the Victorian capital about a week ago.

A GoPro camera, headphones and a wetsuit were also stolen, with police saying Ginn had left them along with the medals inside his car during a speaking engagement at a school.

Ginn is one of Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletes and was a member of the champion rowing crew known as [“The Oarsome Foursome.”](https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/drew-ginn/)

He won the medals during a nearly two decade Olympic career that began at the 1996 games in Atlanta and continued through to the London Olympics in 2012.

“They’ve got a lot of value for family and friends… but you can’t insure them,” Ginn told public broadcaster [ABC Radio Melbourne](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-breakfast/drew-ginn/104336196) on Friday.

“They were hidden away in the car but the car was ransacked completely so lots of stuff was broken and destroyed,” he added.

The 49-year-old voiced hope that, rather than being sold, the medals might find their way back to their rightful owner.
